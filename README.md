# KOI-3138
false positive analysis and planet candidate validation of KOI-3138.01
codes contain various data plots of different ground-based observations of KOI-3138.01. The most important code is exclusion_zones.py which plots the regions of magnitude and separation parameter space surrounding the host star KOI-3138.01 in which a false positive (i.e. transit-inducing, non-exoplanet) source cannot reside based on observation.
